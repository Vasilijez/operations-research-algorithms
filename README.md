# Operations Research Algorithms
The repository contains several optimization algorithms suitable for different types of problems. Some of them are specially intended for linear programming problems, like Simplex, Hungarian, and the Transportation method. Additionally, it includes a more general-purpose algorithmâ€”the genetic algorithm.
